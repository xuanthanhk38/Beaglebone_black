For the succesful boot of BBB, we need:

 Apply power ---> RBL (ROM Boot Loader)--> SPL/ML0 --> U-boot --> Linux Kernel --> RFS (root file system

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. FIRST STAGE: RBL
->Stack setup
->Watchdog timer configuaration
->System clock configuration using PLL
->Search memory devices or boot interfaces for MLO/SPL
->Copy MLO/SPL into the internal SRAM of the chip
-> Execute  MLO/SPL

Details:

1 ROM Boot Loader
 After apply power the RBL is the first software component to run on the SOC. the ROM code does the initial initializtions:
  - CPU, static ram, sd card (if uboot stored in sd card), wdt, clock (PLL)
  
   if the RBL could not able to load the second stage within the timer in watchdog then WDG timer will exprie and it will reset the board.
   
 Load SPL/MLO Into the RAM

After that the RBL goes for the booting, it want to load the second stage boot loader found in the external memory or peripherals.
- it will go through all the boot list and the loop is exited if a valid booting is found and executed or upon the watchdog expiration. Please refer to the boot_mode.txt for boot list.

- Ex, it find the second stage boot on the eMMC memory (or sd card) of the board, then the ROM code copies the MLO/SPL to the internal RAM of the SOC.
- The MLO/SPL will have its own image header and it is decided by manufactor


	------------------------
	| load_addr = 0xx000000 | } image header | ==> MLO
	| size                  |                |
	|------------------------                |
	|   SPL                 |                |
	|                       |                |
	|                       |                |
	|------------------------                |
	
	(SPL and MLO are almost same except the MLO has a header which contain some info like load address, size of the image...)
- The RBL first read the image header of the MLO, from the image header it will get 2 informations.
	+ One is the load address
	+ another one is the total size of the MLO
- The RBL will load the MLO to the internal RAM address indicated by the image header of the MLO
- After this stage. RBL's job is almost over it will start the exucation of the MLO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II. MLO/SPL job
+ it does UART console initialization to print out the debug message
+ reconfigure the PLL to the desired value
+ initializes the DDR register to use the DDR memory
+ Does muxing configuration of boot peripherals pin, because its next job is load the u-boot from the boot peripherals.
+ copy the uboot image into the DDR memory
