Based on S2 button (BBB boot button) we got 2 configurations:

1. S2 released - SYSBOOT[4:0] = [11100]
 The boot order will be:
 	1 MMMC1 (eMMC)
 	2 MMC0 (SD card)
 	3 UART0
 	4 USB0
 
 2. S2 pressed (SYSBOOT[4:0] = 11000) the boot order will be:
 	1 SPI0
 	2 MMC0 (SD card)
 	3 USB0
 	4 UART0
 	
 So, there are 5 boot mode supported for this board including SPI
 
1. eMMC Boot (MMC1):
  eMMC is connected over MMC1 interface, this is the fastest boot mode possible and it is right there on the board
  we do not need to add any external component for booting, this is the default boot mode.
  When you reset the board, the board start booting from loading the images stored in the eMMC.
  And if no boot image is found in the eMMC, the board will automatically try to boot from next device on the list.
  
2. SD card
 If the default ( that is booting from eMMC) boot mode fails, then it will try to
 boot from the SD card you connected to the sd card connector at MMC0
 interface.
 If you press S2 and then apply the power, then the board will try to boot from
 the SPI first, and if nothing is connected to SPI, it will try to boot from the
 MMC0 where our SD card is found
 Also remember that we can use SD card boot to flash boot images on the
 eMMC. So if you want to write new images on the eMMC then you can boot
 through sd card, then write new images to eMMC, then reset the board, so
 that your board can boot using new images stored in the eMMC.
